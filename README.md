# Emotion-classifcation-using-EEG-and-RNN
For the final project of our neural networks course, my team and I decided to attempt the classification of human emotion states based on EEG data using recurrent neural networks. We used a random forest classifier as our baseline and attempted to improve the recurrent network as much as possible to reach the level of accuracy that the random forest classifier is at.

Our team consisted of myself, Cristina Ropot, Mik Claessens and Amanda Komulainen.
